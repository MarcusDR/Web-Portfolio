I'd like to take this oppurtunity to make a website displaying some photography. I specialize in astrophotography but I also added a wildlife section for fun. 
I made an about page listing my equipment but I'd like to add some explanations to some of the equipment that most people will be unfamiliar with.

I'd also like to add a new html page for every image that leads to a full screen view of each image although I'm not sure how to do that as of yet as the images are too big to be uploaded onto github.
